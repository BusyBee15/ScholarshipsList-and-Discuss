Here I'm trying to build a website which lists scholarships that a student can avail

### Features

- Main page lists the scholarships

- Contact page - where users can send message to admin about a scholarship which they know and not listed in the website

- Discuss section : Admin will create channels for each scholarship listed in the main page , user can join the channel and ask queries among themselves.

- Admin page - admin will have access to edit the list of scholarships

  <br/>

Tech stack used:

- HTML5, CSS
- React (hooks, react routing, react icons)
- Stream : to build discuss section
